/**
 * API for communication between different endpoints in the occupant zones in the car.
 * <p>
 * Unless specified explicitly, a client means an app that uses this API and runs as a
 * foreground user in an occupant zone, while a peer client means an app that has the same package
 * name as the caller app and runs as another foreground user (in another occupant zone or even
 * another Android system).
 * An endpoint means a component (such as a Fragment or an Activity) that has an instance of
 * {@link CarOccupantConnectionManager}.
 * <p>
 * Communication between apps with different package names is not supported.
 * <p>
 * A common use case of this API is like:
 * <pre>
 *     ==========================================        =========================================
 *     =        client1 (occupantZone1)         =        =        client2 (occupantZone2)        =

 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Client1 and client2 must have the same package name. Client1 runs in occupantZone1
 *        while client2 runs in occupantZone2. Sender1A (an endpoint in client1) wants to
 *        send a {@link Payload} to receiver2A (an endpoint in client2).
 *   <li> Pre-connection:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li> The client app inherits {@link AbstractReceiverService} and declares the service in
 *            its manifest file.
 *     </ul>
 *   <li> Establish connection:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li> Sender1A monitors occupantZone2 by calling {@link
 *            android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#registerStateCallback}.
 *       <li> Sender1A waits until the {@link OccupantZoneState} of occupantZone2 becomes
 *            {@link android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#FLAG_OCCUPANT_ZONE_CONNECTION_READY} and
 *            the {@link AppState} of client2 becomes {@link
 *            android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#FLAG_CLIENT_INSTALLED}, then requests a connection
 *            to occupantZone2 by calling {@link #requestConnection}. If UI is needed to establish
 *            the connection, sender1A must wait until {@link
 *            android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#FLAG_OCCUPANT_ZONE_SCREEN_UNLOCKED} and {@link
 *            android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#FLAG_CLIENT_IN_FOREGROUND}).
 *       <li> ReceiverService2 is started and bound by car service ({@link
 *            com.android.car.occupantconnection.CarOccupantConnectionService} automatically.
 *            ReceiverService2 is notified via {@link
 *            AbstractReceiverService#onConnectionInitiated}.
 *       <li> ReceiverService2 accepts the connection by calling {@link
 *            AbstractReceiverService#acceptConnection}.
 *       <li> Then the one-way connection is established. Sender1A is notified via {@link
 *            ConnectionRequestCallback#onConnected}, and ReceiverService2 is notified via
 *            {@link AbstractReceiverService#onConnected}.
 *     </ul>
 *   <li> Send Payload:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li> Sender1A sends a Payload to occupantZone2 by calling {@link #sendPayload}. To indicate
 *            that the Payload is sent to receiver2A, Sender1A puts receiver2A's ID ("receiver2A")
 *            into the Payload.
 *       <li> ReceiverService2 is notified for the Payload via {@link
 *            AbstractReceiverService#onPayloadReceived}.
 *            In this method, ReceiverService2 can forward the Payload to client2's receiver
 *            endpoints (if any), or cache the Payload and forward it later once a new receiver
 *            endpoint is registered.
 *     </ul>
 *   <li> Register receiver:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li> Receiver2A calls {@link #registerReceiver} with ID "receiver2A". Then
 *            ReceiverService2 is notified via {@link AbstractReceiverService#onReceiverRegistered}.
 *            In that method, ReceiverService2 parses the Payload and finds that the Payload should
 *            be sent to the endpoint with ID "receiver2A", then invokes {@link
 *            AbstractReceiverService#forwardPayload} to forward the cached Payload to receiver2A.
 *            <p>
 *            Note: this step can be done before "Establish connection". In this case,
 *            ReceiverService2 will be started and bound by car service early.
 *            Once sender1A sends a Payload to occupantZone2, ReceiverService2 will be notified
 *            via {@link AbstractReceiverService#onReceiverRegistered}. In that method,
 *            ReceiverService2 can forward the Payload to Receiver2A without caching.
 *       <li> Receiver2A is notified for the Payload via {@link PayloadCallback#onPayloadReceived}.
 *     </ul>
 *   <li> Terminate the connection:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Sender1A terminates the connection to occupantZone2:
 *          Once sender1A no longer needs to send Payload to occupantZone2, it terminates the
 *          connection by calling {@link #disconnect}. Then sender1A is notified via
 *          {@link ConnectionRequestCallback#onDisconnected}, and ReceiverService2 is notified via
 *          {@link AbstractReceiverService#onDisconnected}.
 *     <li> Unregister receiver2A:
 *          Once receiver2A no longer needs to receive Payload from any other occupant zones,
 *          it calls {@link #unregisterReceiver}.
 *    <li> Unbound and destroy ReceiverService2:
 *         Since all the senders have disconnected from occupantZone2 and there is no receiver
 *         registered in occupantZone2, ReceiverService2 will be unbound and destroyed
 *         automatically.
 *   </ul>
 *   <li> Sender1A stops monitoring other occupant zones by calling {@link
 *        android.car.CarRemoteDeviceManager#unregisterStateCallback}. This step can
 *        be done before or after "Terminate the connection".
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For a given {@link android.car.Car} instance, the CarOccupantConnectionManager is a singleton.
 * However, the client app may create multiple {@link android.car.Car} instances thus create
 * multiple CarOccupantConnectionManager instances. These CarOccupantConnectionManager instances
 * are treated as the same instance for the client app. For example:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Sender1A creates a CarOccupantConnectionManager instance (managerA), while sender1B
 *        creates a different CarOccupantConnectionManager instance (managerB). Then sender1A uses
 *        managerA to request a connection to occupantZone2. Once connected, sender1B can use
 *        managerB to send Payload to occupantZone2 without requesting a new connection.
 *        To know whether it is connected to occupantZone2, sender1B can call {@link #isConnected}.
 *   <li> Besides, sender1B can terminate the connection by calling managerB#disconnect(), despite
 *        that the connection was requested by sender1A. Once the connection is terminated, sender1A
 *        will be notified via {@link ConnectionRequestCallback#onDisconnected}, and sender1B will
 *        not be notified since it didn't register register the {@link ConnectionRequestCallback}.
 * </ul>
