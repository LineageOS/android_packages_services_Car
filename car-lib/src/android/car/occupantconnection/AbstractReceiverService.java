/**
 * A service used to respond to connection requests from peer clients on other occupant zones,
 * receive {@link Payload} from peer clients, cache the received Payload, and dispatch it to the
 * receiver endpoints in this client.
 * <p>
 * The client app must extend this service to receive Payload from peer clients. When declaring
 * this service in the manifest file, the client must add an intent filter with action
 * {@value android.car.Car#CAR_INTENT_ACTION_RECEIVER_SERVICE} for this service, and require
 * {@code android.car.occupantconnection.permission.BIND_RECEIVER_SERVICE}. For example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <service android:name=".MyReceiverService"
 *          android:permission="android.car.occupantconnection.permission.BIND_RECEIVER_SERVICE"
 *          android:exported="true">
 *     <intent-filter>
 *         <action android:name="android.car.intent.action.RECEIVER_SERVICE" />
 *     </intent-filter>
 * </service>}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This service runs on the main thread of the client app, and is a singleton for the client app.
 * The lifecycle of this service is managed by car service ({@link
 * com.android.car.occupantconnection.CarOccupantConnectionService}).
 * <p>
 * This service can be bound by car service in two ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A sender endpoint in the peer client calls {@link
 *        CarOccupantConnectionManager#requestConnection} to connect to this client.
 *   <li> A receiver endpoint in this client calls {@link
 *        CarOccupantConnectionManager#registerReceiver}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Once all the senders have disconnected from this client and there is no receiver endpoints
 * registered in this client, this service will be unbound by car service automatically.
 * <p>
 * When this service is crashed, all connections to this client will be terminated. As a result,
 * all senders that were connected to this client will be notified via {@link
 * CarOccupantConnectionManager.ConnectionRequestCallback#onDisconnected}. In addition, the cached
 * Payload will be lost, if any. The senders are responsible for resending the Payload if needed.
 *
