# Runtime property config file for car service.

CarSvcProps.json is auto-generated by
`packages/services/Car/tools/vehiclepropertyidsparser/prebuilt/VehiclePropertyIdsParser.jar`.

Do not manually update the file. Update
`packages/services/Car/car-lib/src/android/car/VehiclePropertyIds.java` and run the parser to auto
generate instead.
