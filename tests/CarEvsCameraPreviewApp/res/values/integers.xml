        Restrict activity's recreation for below types of configuration changes. Please visit
        https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes for more details.

        We are using this magic number trick because configChanges flag for rro, which is
        0x80000000, is not defined yet.

        TODO(b/312220666): This restriction may not be needed if we decouple a management of
                           the camera resource from the Activity's lifecycle.
