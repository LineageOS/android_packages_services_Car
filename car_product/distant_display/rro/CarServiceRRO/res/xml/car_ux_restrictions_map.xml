    <!-- Map the driving states to UX restrictions here -->
    <!-- Note - The platform takes a fully restricted approach when there is no information or if
    the information is malformed.  As a result,
    1. Default values for requiresDistractionOptimization is true, and uxr is fully_restricted.
    2. If uxr != baseline, then requiresDistractionOptimization is automatically promoted to true,
    even if it is declared as false.  Because it doesn't make sense to have an non baseline UX
    restriction without requiresDistractionOptimization set to true.
    So if we don't want any restrictions, requiresDistractionOptimization should be explicitly
    marked as false and uxr should be explicitly set to baseline. -->
